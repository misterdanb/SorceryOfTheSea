# Sorcery of the Sea (working title the wind wizard)

This game for the original game boy was made by [@wobinichhierhin](https://github.com/wobinichhierhin) and me during the Hasi (Hackspace Siegen, http://hasi.it) game jam in september 2018.
Some code of tobu tobu girl has been reused as a starting point. Have fun playing the game! :D
